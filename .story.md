## Passing the first few test cases
As the next step we implement our `Game` class and ensure that our first few test cases will pass.

So, we went ahead and added some tests covering basic game functionalities.
See [GameTest](src/test/java/GameTest.java:11:34)

Covering a few basic functionalities will lead you to a [Game](src/main/java/bowling/Game.java) class implementation
that can look similar.

But soon after we cover these we need to decide how to approach the [next test](src/test/java/GameTest.java:37)

h2. Notes

* Validation is not equal to invariant. 
* Invariants should be encapsulated inside the class itself.
* Using validation in a different layer might lead us to the "Smart UI anti-pattern" 

Looking at the second sentence of the requirements will also reveal that we should continue with
splitting up the problem space and try not to force everything into the `Game` class.

> In each frame the player has two rolls to knock down 10 pins 

So we have to create a `Frame` class which captures these rules.
