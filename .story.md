## Strikes and Spares
We will extend the functionality of the `Frame` class.
Let's look at the two rules related to strikes and spares:

> *"A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two rolls. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll."* 
>
> *"A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first roll. The frame is then completed with a single roll. The bonus for that frame is the value of the next two rolls."* 

In case, when player rolls a **spare** we have to get number of pins knocked down by the next roll.
This has to be retrieved from the next frame. So we need to introduce an association between each `Frame`.
Let's try to capture this rule in our [next test case.](src/test/java/bowling/FrameTest.java:46)

We can't implement this functionality without knowing about the [next `Frame`](src/main/java/bowling/Frame.java:10) in our class.
Defining [a spare](src/main/java/bowling/Frame.java:55) in the `Frame` class is simple and straightforward.
After it is declared, we can extend our `score()` function with the [appropriate rule](src/main/java/bowling/Frame.java:41-43).

Adding a srtike is almost identical. You can see the test case [here](src/test/java/bowling/FrameTest.java:57),
the implementation [here](src/main/java/bowling/Frame.java:47) and [here](src/main/java/bowling/Frame.java:38-40).

I added an additional [test case](src/test/java/bowling/FrameTest.java:68) just to be sure, that we can
get a score even when the rolls for the next frame are still ahead of us. Looks like this works without any
new implementation added to the `Frame` class.
