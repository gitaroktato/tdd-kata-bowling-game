## Introducing Frame
We will now concentrate only on the specification of our `Frame` class.
Let's look at the first two rules for frames in the requirement:

> *"In each frame the player has two rolls to knock down 10 pins"* 
>
> *"The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down..."* 

First, we will just disable the failing test case in [GameTest](src/test/java/bowling/GameTest.java:48).

Now let's start with the new test cases around `Frame`.
I created a new `FrameTest` class and added the first few [test cases](src/test/java/bowling/FrameTest.java:11-39)

In the [Frame](src/main/java/bowling/Frame.java:10) implementation we're just storing 
the first and the second roll and [summing up the results](src/main/java/bowling/Frame.java:32).

This will do it for now, good thing is that it's easy to keep the following invariants within a `Frame`

* Sum of the first two rolls in a frame [can be 10 at maximum](src/main/java/bowling/Frame.java:10)
* Player can have [only two rolls in a frame](src/main/java/bowling/Frame.java:19)

By introducing the rules for strikes and spares, things will get much more complicated.
