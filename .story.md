## Strikes and Spares
We will extend the functionality of the `Frame` class.
Let's look at the two rules related to strikes and spares:

> *"A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two rolls. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll."* 
>
> *"A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first roll. The frame is then completed with a single roll. The bonus for that frame is the value of the next two rolls."* 

In case, when player rolls a **spare** we have to get number of pins knocked down by the next roll.
This has to be retrieved from the next frame. So we need to introduce an association between each `Frame`.
Let's try to capture this rule in our [next test case](src/test/java/bowling/FrameTest.java:46)
